# products-app
Products display app built with React typescript and an express backend. 

The Admin user was automatically put into the database. It is user with email joe.santhosh88@yahoo.com
The screen recording will be attached to this README. The recording is low resolution because I needed to compress it to attach it to the github.

In order to run the application:

```
git clone https://github.com/joesanthosh24/products-app
cd api
npm install
npm run dev
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
 
Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser after running the above commands

Database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas
